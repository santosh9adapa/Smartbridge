# Global Malnutrition Trends: A Power BI Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global malnutrition trends from 1983 to 2019 using Power BI. The objective is to understand the prevalence and distribution of malnutrition among children under five years of age across different economic classifications and geographical categories. The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset sourced from UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank.

## Objectives
- Analyze severe wasting, wasting, stunting, underweight, and overweight conditions among children under five.
- Identify correlations between economic status and malnutrition rates.
- Classify countries by income levels and other classifications such as Least Developed Countries (LDC), Low Income Food Deficient (LIFD), Land Locked Developing Countries (LLDC), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).
- Utilize Power BI visualization techniques to generate actionable insights.

## Scenarios Analyzed
1. **Count of U5 Population** - Number of observations related to the under-five population.
2. **Sum of Survey Sample** - Total sum of survey samples collected (343M).
3. **Sum of Underweight** - Total number of underweight cases (14.29K).
4. **Sum of LDC, LIFD, LLDC or SID2 and Average of Stunting by Income Analysis** - Evaluates the relationship between economic classification and stunting.
5. **Sum of Overweight by Country** - Analyzes overweight prevalence by country.
6. **Sum of Overweight and Underweight under Income Classification** - Examines trends across income levels.
7. **Sum of Income Classification** - Analyzes total income within income brackets.
